# pyanselus

A Python module implementing various components and services to enable creation of [Anselus](https://anselus.org) clients released under the MIT license.

## Description

pyanselus originally started as a quickie test client to interact with server code and guide client-side spec development. As it developed, though, it has taken on a shape of its own. It has been written primarily in mind for development of the CLI Anselus client [Smilodon](https://github.com/darkwyrm/smilodon), but it is implemented in a generic way that it can be used for any Anselus client development.

## Status

The application is in early development. The code still has much of the original Smilodon code mixed in and is being removed.

## Building

Setup is a matter of checking out the repository, setting up your virtual environment, and `pip install -r requirements.txt`, and then `pip install .`. Once it is more stable, it will be available from PyPi.
